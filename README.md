# FSU-2022-26
Projects from my time spent at FSU, these projects were very self guided (Doesn't include programs/projects that may be reused by the university)

## Senior Year Projects 
During my Senior year I had done many individual projects in classes along my research in the Kira lab. 

A class I took that allowed me to understand biological data analysis widely was Bioinformatics, taught in R at FSU. For a Midterm project, we used real RNA-Seq data from a list of datasets. I analyzed data on the affect of retonic acid breakdown on proximal and distal regeneration of limbs in Axolotls. For the final project, I had analyzed SNPs in immmune cells in a GWAS study. The final project had expectations of analysing larger data and having a more in-depth analysis. In Both of these projects, you can find a .rmd file that has the code, outputs, and the analysis I conducted for both projects. Tables are also provided. 

For my senior year, I also enrolled in Symbolic and Numeric Computation for Scientific Applications. In this course, we had understood Matlab semantics by having weekly quizzes on a textbook. The class was experimenting in a different teaching style, where we would read the chapter in the textbook and take quizzes, but use AI primarily through prompting. This course had shown me how to prompt ChatGPT to get viable code and how to look for mistakes within ChatGPT.
